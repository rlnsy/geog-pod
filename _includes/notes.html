				<p>When discussing the median value-to-income ratio for homes, the 9 times value-to-income figure is for Vancouver homes specifically in 2008. Vancouver is home to many Aboriginal groups such as the Musqueam and Coast Salish, and in 2016 had a population of 61'455 Aboriginal people, the largest Aboriginal population of areas included in the census of metropolitan cities.</p>
